      <p>Track and Field is one of the oldest sports, these contests were often held at religous festivals and also were apart of the Greek Olympic Games. It wasnt until the 1860s that the sport began to truly. In 1866 the first English championships were held by the newly formed Amateur Athletic Club. All races started by the firing of the gun by an official at the starting line.For races up to and including one lap of an outdoor track, runners must stay in their lane. There are usally six to eight lanes and winners are based on whose torso first crosses the finish line.Sprinters use a crouch start in which, after being commanded to get "on your marks" by the starter, the contestant kneels with one knee on the ground and both hands resting behind the starting line. On the "get set" command, the sprinter raises the knee from the ground in anticipation of the gun. When it fires, the runner will accelerate as quickly as possible from the starting line. To facilitate a quick start by giving the runner something to push off against, devices known as starting blocks are used.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
